# Introductory Page

## Professional Self-Introduction
Hello, my name is **Cesar Garrido**, and I am a cybersecurity student with a strong interest in Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, incident response, industrial control systems (ICS), and hands-on technical labs. I am building practical skills through coursework, technical labs, and home projects. I am especially interested in how real-world threats impact networks, critical infrastructure, and end users, and how SOC teams detect and respond to those threats.

## Career Goal
My career goal is to work in cybersecurity with a focus on Security Operations Center (SOC) work, threat detection, and incident response, with a growing interest in securing industrial control systems (ICS) and critical infrastructure. I plan to continue developing hands-on technical skills, earn industry certifications, and pursue professional experience in security operations roles where I can contribute to detecting and responding to real-world threats.

## Role Model
A role model I look up to is **DJ Shipley**, a highly decorated former U.S. Navy SEAL and Tier 1 (DEVGRU) operator with 17 years of service. After being medically retired, he co-founded GBRS Group and became known for sharing insights on discipline, routine, resilience, and high performance. His teachings focus on developing an unbreakable mindset, maintaining consistency, and pursuing continuous self-improvement.

> “Being a professional isn’t a title. It’s a responsibility. Every single day, you’re sharpening your craft, refining your edge, and chasing that 1% better than yesterday.”

DJ Shipley’s emphasis on discipline, routine, and daily improvement influences how I approach cybersecurity learning and hands-on labs. His mindset reinforces the importance of consistency, accountability, and continuous progression when developing technical skills for real-world security operations and incident response.
